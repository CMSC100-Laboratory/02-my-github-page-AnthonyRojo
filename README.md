What are your key takeaways from this exercise?  
I learned how to build a single-page static website from scratch using pure HTML and CSS, which helped me understand the importance of clean code structure and file organization. During development, I applied basic UI design principles and significantly improved my skills in version control, proper commits, and documentation. Finally, I gained practical deployment experience by launching the site using GitHub Pages.
